## Data-Compression(Feature-Extraction)
### The goal of this repository is to get you accustomed with the most widely used Unsupervised form of feature extraction technique known as the Principal Component Analysis, via the Singular Valued Decompition technique(SVD). Using SVD can essentially help in visualizing the PCA projection and can easily help in understanding the working of PCA.  Lastly, I will also perform an elaborate comparison between the Dual version of PCA and conclude with which is optimum for usage.
### Note : SVD has been carried out step-by-step without using any linear algerba libraries to simplify the mathematical steps.
### This repository comprises of two major sections :-
### - PCA with SVD 
### - Dual-PCA with SVD
### *Key takeaways from this post : -
### - Dual-PCA is much more efficient than direct PCA (In terms of storage and speed)
### - It is useful when the dimensionality of the data is very high as compared to that of the sample size.
### - Lastly, it provides an opportunity for kernelizing the PCA
