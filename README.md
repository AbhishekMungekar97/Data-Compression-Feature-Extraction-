## Data-Compression(Feature-Extraction)
### The goal of this repository is to get you accustomed with the most widely used Unsupervised form of the feature extraction technique known as the Principal Component Analysis, via the Singular Valued Decompition technique(SVD). Using SVD can essentially help in visualizing the PCA projection and can easily help in understanding the working of PCA. Lastly, we will also compare between the Dual version of PCA and conclude with which is optimum for usage.
### Note : SVD has been carried out step-by-step without using any linear algerba libraries to simplify the mathematical step.
### This repository comprises of two major sections :-
### - PCA with SVD 
### - Dual-PCA with SVD
